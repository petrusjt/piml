# PIML

## Update

Now there is a [chrome extension](https://github.com/petrusjt/piml-chrome-extension) available for directly opening .piml files in chrome.

## Description
Converts a python-like indented text to html.

## Usage

```bash
py piml.py <input_file> [output_file]
```
Files must be given with extensions.

If `output_file` is omitted it prints the HTML to to console.

## Note

Indentation must be done with spaces. 

## Example

The `test.piml` file is an example input file with `test.html` as the output.
